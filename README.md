## Introduction

This module allows @inline<Document>[id]{label} to be used to put one field from the referenced document inline in the current document.

## Limitation

When @inlineCompendium is used, the first time the document is opened a placeholder will be displayed. Re-opening the document should display the correct text. (This is required because the compendium entry(ies) need to be read from the server before they can be used).

## Configuration

In the module settings, you can define which field is read from each document type. These are likely to be specific to each game-system.

## Support
